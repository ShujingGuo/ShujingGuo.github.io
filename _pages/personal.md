Self-disclosure
-----
* I have a foundation in positive attitude, strong learning ability, sufficient motivation, and pressure resistance. 
* I like singing, hiking and making new friends.
* I like dogs especially golden retrievers and beagles :)
* I also like cats, they are so individual and arrogant :)
